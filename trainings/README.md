EmbeddedTeam Trainings
======================

We have today embedded trainings planned around two boards we got from Atmel:
* Atmel SAM4S-Xplained, integrating ATSAM4S16C and a Segger JLink-OB (OnBoard)
* Atmel SAMA5-Xplained, integrating ATSAMA5D36

We thank Atmel France SAS people from Rousset (various teams) for these gifts.
The team APPS/RFO provided us the Slides which will be the basis of SAM4S trainings.
